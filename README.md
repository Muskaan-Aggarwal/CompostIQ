# -AI-Powered-Agri-Waste-Composting-Optimization-project

## Overview

The AI-Powered Agri-Waste Composting Optimization project aims to develop a machine learning model that optimizes the composting process for agricultural waste. The goal is to enhance compost quality, improve process efficiency, and provide actionable insights for farmers to manage composting better. The project leverages AI and data-driven methods to monitor key factors and predict compost quality over time.

## Key Features

1. ***Data-Driven Insights:*** Collect data on essential composting parameters such as temperature, moisture content, pH, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, aeration rate, and composting duration.
2. ***Machine Learning Models:*** Utilize supervised machine learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Trees, etc.) to predict compost quality and optimize the composting process.
3. ***Feature Engineering:*** Incorporate interaction terms and domain-specific features (e.g., Temperature-Moisture Interaction) to improve model performance.
4. ***Actionable Recommendations:*** Provide data-driven recommendations for farmers to adjust parameters during the composting process for better results.

## Project Objectives
1. ***Enhance Compost Quality:*** Optimize conditions that affect compost quality, such as moisture, temperature, and pH, through AI predictions.
2. ***Improve Composting Efficiency:*** Reduce the time and effort required by identifying the most efficient composting practices.
3. ***Provide Data-Driven Insights:*** Leverage AI to offer recommendations based on real-time data analysis for effective compost management.

## Dataset

The project relies on agricultural waste composting data, including key parameters such as:
1. Temperature (Â°C)
2. Moisture Content (%)
3. pH Level
4. Carbon-to-Nitrogen (C/N) Ratio
5. Aeration Rate
6. Composting Duration (Days)
7. Initial Composition of Waste
8. Additives Used (e.g., Biochar, Lime)
9. Turning Frequency (times per week)

## Synthetic Data Generation

For initial development and testing, synthetic data is generated to simulate the composting process. Key variables such as temperature, moisture, and pH are modeled using normal and uniform distributions to replicate real-world behavior.
